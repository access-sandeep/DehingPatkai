In this section, we see how we can connect our Redux code with React application. There are two ways to connect our redux code with react application.

Manual way to connect

using React-redux library

First, we add our redux store folder in our React application. Then we can connect our redux with react.

If we use a manual way to connect, then we have to manually write subscribe and pass store in all our components using react context.

But if we use the react-redux library, we donâ€™t need to do any of these steps. This library does that for us.

In this library, we have two hooks for functional components.

useDispatch

useSelector

useDispatch is used to dispatch action from any component and useSelector is used to get value from a redux store.

So react-redux library will make our code clean and maintainable.
